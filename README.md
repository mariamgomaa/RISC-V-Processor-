RISC-V Single-Cycle RV-32I Processor

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a 32-bit Single-Cycle RV-32I RISC-V Processor based on the Harvard architecture.
The processor executes an entire instruction in a single clock cycle â€” including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back, and PC update.
The design was implemented in Verilog HDL and deployed on a CycloneÂ® IV FPGA device.
It was developed as the final project for the IEEE Digital Design Workshop.
